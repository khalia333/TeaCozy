This is my Codecademy Week 4 Project. The goal was to create a website based on a specific design spec using the skills I have learned so far during my courses. Learning flexbox has been the most difficult part to grasp for me so far, so this project was a bit challenging. I know there is no single correct way to have built the web page, but I do hope that I have done it in a way that is logical and doesn't have too much unnecessary coding.
